# Scorekeeper Repository

This simple project was created as part of Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy.

The logic for this project was coded without tutorial, based on having observed functionality of the finished project in the tutorial.

Refactoring was done with help of the tutorial as I am still learning JavaScript and did not realize that JavaScript objects could have HTML elements assigned as their member variables.
